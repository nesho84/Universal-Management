# Universal-Management
Office Management Software

After some years I decided to Upload this project on GitHub and is Totally free to use.
Maybe it will help Someone to start with Programming

Note: It's a basic C# Project with MySQL Database and maybe you will find some bugs and errors

To work on your Machine you need first to follow some Instructions bellow:
1. A running Service on Localhost Apache and MySQL
2. Import the um_db.sql on your MySQL Database
3. MySQL-User.txt is the file for the User permission on MySQL Admin or you change it whatever you want.
4. Open the Project with Visual Studio and run it :)

I hope you enjoy it.
